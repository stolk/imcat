# Platform

Supports Linux, MacOS and Microsoft Windows 10 terminals.


## Introduction

Do you ever find yourself logged into a server, over SSH, but there is no X11 connection.
And you want to see the contents of an image?

imcat to the rescue!

imcat is a 24-bit image viewer that uses ANSI terminal colours to display any image supported by STB.
It automatically resizes to the width of your terminal, using proper sampling kernels.

imcat also works on the latest version of Windows 10.

## Usage

```
$ imcat [options] file1 [file2 .. fileN]
```

Use `-h {NUM}` and `-w {NUM}` specify the height or width of the output image respectively. Note: only `width` will be
used if both dimensions are passed.

```
$ imcat -w 10 {IMG_PATH}
```

Use `-f` or `--fit` to have the output image fit to the console size. Note: `fit` will override both `height` and 
`width` arguments.

```
$ imcat -f {IMG_PATH}
```

If you want to blend the image with the terminal background, then you need to specify the background color of your terminal. For instance:

```
$ export IMCATBG="#dad9cc"
```

## Todo

* Handle alpha-transparency. Requires reading the terminal background colour, somehow. Tricky.

## Done

* Correct for aspect ratio of terminal font.

## Building

### Unix
On Linux, just use 'make' to build the imcat binary.

### Windows 10
On Windows, you need clang.exe from Visual Studio 2017 to build the imcat.exe binary. It's actually quite hard to get that compiler working, so you may just as well grab the pre-built <A HREF="https://stolk.org/imcat/imcat.exe">imcat.exe</A> binary.
